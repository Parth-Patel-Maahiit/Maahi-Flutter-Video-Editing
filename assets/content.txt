Many Flutter widgets support scrolling out of the box and do most of the work for you. For example, SingleChildScrollView automatically scrolls its child when necessary. Other useful widgets include ListView and GridView . You can check out more of these widgets on the scrolling page of the Widget catalog.To load content from another text file and display it in place of _currentSpeech, you can read the content of the file and assign it to the _currentSpeech variable. Here's how you can do it
First, make sure you have the text file containing the content you want to display. For example, let's assume you have a text file named content.txt in the assets folder of your project.
Then, you can use the rootBundle to load the content of the file and assign it to _currentSpeech in the initState method.
